# SteamCentral
<b>SteamCentral</b> was designed as a web-based web application whose purpose is an easy and clear presentation of statistics reflecting the <b>Steam</b> user progress in <b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</b> game. 

The main user panel after logging through the <b>Steam</b> platform (login system has not yet been implemented) presents the main user statistics, detailed data related to the course of the last match played and statistics for individual types of weapons that are associated with the most valuable skins (according to the prices of items in the <b>Steam Marketplace</b>) in the <b>Steam</b> user's inventory. 

The ability to filter individual weapon types by name, sorting them into many options related to statistics, as well as showing those that are active only for individual sides during the game provides an easy analysis of the various aspects of gameplay. 

User are able to compare their statistics with any friend who has a copy of <b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</b>, as well as with any other player profile who provides personal statistics in public mode so that they can easily compare their skills and draw conclusions from the analyzed data. 

By generating real-time charts from the collected <b>Steam</b> user statistics stored in the database, user has the possibility of in-depth analysis of personal data creating various combinations associated with its daily or total progress in the game.
